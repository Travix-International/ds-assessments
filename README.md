The goal of this assessment is for you to show us your data science experience, focusing on the first stages in a project.

## Case

When a customer is booking a flight on our website, we also offer him the opportunity to buy ancillary products like insurance, airport parking etc. with the flight. Our commercial department is interested to get more insights in the sales of our ancillary products.  They are interested to know which customers are more likely to buy a specific ancillary product. 

They have provided a dataset on flight bookings and ancillary sales. Each row in the dataset represents a flight booking. The columns present some information on the booking (date, flight information, etc.) and whether the specific ancillary product was also bought by the customer (HasAncillary column).

The commercial team asked our team (the data science team) to work on a model that can predict how likely a customer is to buy this ancillary product (based on the information provided in the dataset).

## Assessment
Your task is to analyse the data, present insights from the data to the business and take a first step in modelling. This first modeling step involves a first (simple) model that will give an idea of what is possible and what needs to be done, but it doesn’t have to be perfect or “production ready” in any way. You are expected to spend 4-6 hours on the case, definitely not more.
We are asking you to share your notebook/Python code via email or GitHub before the interview.

In order to discuss your results, we’ll schedule a conversation which will start with a short presentation given by you. This presentation should include your results from the data analysis and modeling and what would be your next steps. The presentation is aimed at a business representative (product owner). Next to the product owner there will also be a data scientist in the meeting. The presentation has to be 10-15 minutes and there will be an additional 10 minutes for questions on the case.

We're very much looking forward to your solutions! Good luck!
